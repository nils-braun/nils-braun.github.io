I am a PhD student in physics with a large passion for software 
development in python and C++. During my daily work with large 
amounts of data and my time as a data science engineer 
with Blue Yonder I made contact with lots of machine
learning techniques and data science methods.

My PhD thesis covers important parts of the 
software, that will be used to reconstruct billions of 
recorded particle collisions at [Belle II](https://www.belle2.org/),
a large high energy particle physics experiment located in 
Tsukuba, Japan. The whole Belle II collaboration has more 
than 600 members from more than 30 countries, which makes
the work very interesting!

I am developing fast and reliable algorithms, which decide
what fraction of the recorded data should be stored and what
is discarded - because we record a lot more data than we 
can store in time. Also, I am writing pieces of the
reconstruction algorithms itself.

As part of my work at our institute in [Karlsruhe](http://www.etp.kit.edu/)
I was also core admin of our local infrastructure and gained
valuable insights into resource orchestration using ansible 
and docker, as well as storage and batch technologies.

Additional to the things I do in my PhD thesis, 
I am very much interested in Python and data science done 
with Python. My work as a Data Science Engineer at [Blue 
Yonder](https://www.blue-yonder.com/de) boosted this dedication even more. 

In my free time, I am playing the guitar or update myself 
on the newest geek stuff.
